/**
 * The offline drafting path: a deterministic placeholder so the provider flow
 * runs on localhost and in CI with no API key (mirrors the offline extraction
 * path). It states ONLY classification-derived facts — band, value, the derived
 * printed range — and NEVER paraphrases or emits the MedlinePlus excerpt as
 * patient prose. Turning source text into patient-facing sentences is the live
 * model's job, behind the human review gate; a deterministic engine doing it
 * would be a second, ungated draft engine, which is exactly what this project's
 * architecture avoids. It reads as an obvious synthetic placeholder on purpose,
 * so no one mistakes it for real copy or "improves" it into that shadow engine.
