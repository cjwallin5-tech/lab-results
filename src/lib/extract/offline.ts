/**
 * The offline extraction path: pre-authored synthetic fixtures instead of a live
 * model call, so the whole provider flow runs on localhost and in CI with no API
 * key. Fixtures pass through the same schema as a live response, so a malformed
 * fixture fails the same way. This path is for building and tests only — it does
 * not measure extraction accuracy (that's the synthetic PDF corpus + eval, later).
 *
 * Fixtures are imported statically (not read from disk) so they bundle cleanly on
 * Vercel — matching the analyte dictionary's static-import approach. No `fs`, no
 * vendor SDK, no `server-only`: this module is safe to import from tests.
